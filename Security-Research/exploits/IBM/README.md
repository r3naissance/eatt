 ---CVE-2016-3053---

 AIX lsmcode local root exploit. 

 Affected: AIX 6.1/7.1/7.2.0.2


 lqueryroot.sh by @hxmonsegur [2016 //RSL]


 ---CVE-2016-6079---

 AIX lquerylv 5.3, 6.1, 7.1, 7.2 local root exploit. Tested against latest patchset (7100-04)

 This exploit takes advantage of known issues with debugging functions
 within the AIX linker library. We are taking advantage of known 
 functionality, and focusing on badly coded SUID binaries which do not
 adhere to proper security checks prior to seteuid/open/writes.

 The CVEs we will be taking advantage of:
 - CVE-2009-1786: The malloc subsystem in libc in IBM AIX 5.3 and 6.1 allows 
   local users to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on
   the log file associated with the MALLOCDEBUG environment variable. 

 - CVE-2009-2669: A certain debugging component in IBM AIX 5.3 and 6.1 does 
   not properly handle the (1) _LIB_INIT_DBG and (2) _LIB_INIT_DBG_FILE 
   environment variables, which allows local users to gain privileges by 
   leveraging a setuid-root program to create an arbitrary root-owned file 
   with world-writable permissions, related to libC.a (aka the XL C++ runtime
   library) in AIX 5.3 and libc.a in AIX 6.1. 

 - CVE-2014-3074: Runtime Linker Allows Privilege Escalation Via Arbitrary 
   File Writes In IBM AIX.

 In each instance of the aforementioned CVEs, IBM merely patched the binaries 
 which were reported in the original reports as being used for escalation of
 the vulnerabilities. This allowed for the lquerylv binary to slip by their
 patches and become an attack vector.
